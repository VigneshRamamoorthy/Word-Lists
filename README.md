# Word-Lists
Some basic wordlists from different methods. Some just found from various sources, but I have also included my Python Wordlist Generators...to make your own

NOTE: I apologise if one or two of the documents here are copies of my other repository
I decided it was more practical to have a seperate repository for the wordlists alone
as they can be used for a much wider range of applications than pen-testing. So I have created the repo
for my wordlist related oftware, and will re-organize the pen-testing one as and when I feel the need to!

Also one of these wordlists were taken from a scrabble game! yes a scrabble game, it is a FULL list of the English 
dictionary. May be of use, but I was using it as an example for another application (game development idea)
