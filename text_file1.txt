### NOTE ##
# This list is ONLY meant to be used as a test file to configure my fb3.py in the Pen-Testing repo
# The idea was that you test the program on your OWN account
# So to see hoe the software works - and if it is configured properly, put your own password
# into a file like this, among a few other random scrambled characters in a list and watch as 
# the program reaches your password in the list and cracks the account.
# Remove all these comments if you use this but it is easy to make your own!
## You then have to make the wordlists to run with the program - or try one of the others I have added
